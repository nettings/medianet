# [mn] medianet

The [mn] media**net** distribution is a derivative of Debian Linux/RaspiOS.
It was created to turn Raspberry Pis into reliable audio nodes, signal
processors, and streaming endpoints.

> There is now a still experimental but quite usable newer version
> in the `bookworm` branch. Use that if you're feeling lucky or you need to
> deploy on a Raspberry Pi 5. If you are looking for a well-tested version,

The audio system is built around the JACK Audio Connection Kit, complemented
with the mod-host to run LV2 plugins, the zita-njbridge to provide clock
decoupled uncompressed network audio streaming, and many other open-source
audio tools.

The system is meant to run headless and unattended. All parts of the audio
signal chain are run as systemd services, and in the unlikely event that one
process crashes, it will be restarted automatically and its connections
re-established.

System-critical partitions (`/boot` and `/`) are mounted read-only during
normal operation, so the system will tolerate hard shutdowns well. 

## 64-bit vs. 32-bit

The default branch of the [mn] media**net** repository is `bullseye64`,
which will create a 64-bit system based on the *aarch64* build of RaspiOS.
This build is known to work on the Pi4B, Pi400 and Pi3B+, and should work on
the Pi3B.

If you have to run a 32-bit system, change to the 32-bit `bullseye` branch after
checking out the repository:

```
git checkout bullseye
```
This branch should theoretically work on all older models down to the Pi1B,
but this has not been tested. Changes to the 64-bit branch are regularly backported,
but expect the 32-bit branch to lag behind a bit.


## Installation

The distribution provides a set of scripts and a file system overlay to turn
a vanilla Raspbian OS Lite image into a medianet system. That means you can
always easily see what has been changed and how, and the system lends itself
well to continuous integration with upstream.

Please see the installation documentation [INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md) in this
directory for details.

## Usage

### User account and access

The default user account is `medianet`.  All media-related services run as
this user. The password is locked, so access is only possible via SSH public
key authentication. You will be asked to install a suitable ssh public key
to `/home/medianet/.ssh/authorized_keys` during the bootstrapping process.

The user has full sudo rights, but they are protected by the
pam_ssh_agent_auth mechanism, i.e. you can only execute sudo commands if the
correct private key is present in your ssh agent. This improves operational
security such that if `medianet` is ever compromised, the attacker does not
automatically have root access.
Again, you are prompted for the respective public key during bootstrapping.

Depending on your usecase, and if your privilege separation requirements are
not that strict, you can re-use the same key for both purposes.

### Configuration and system state

The system configuration is collected in a single file,
[/etc/medianet/config.json](/overlay/etc/medianet/config.json), from which 
all necessary application config files are generated whenever it changes,
by means of a systemd.path watcher. Outside of hastily introduced new features,
this file comprises the entire state of the system.

A work-in-progress documentation effort can be found in
[CONFIGURATION.md](/CONFIGURATION.md).

The fearless are advised to look into the updater script
[mn_config_update](/overlay/usr/local/bin/mn_config_update) for more
information.

### File systems are read-only

In order to make the system robust against cold shutdowns, the `/boot` and
`/` partitions are mounted read-only. All files or folders that must be
written to during operation but needn't be persistent across reboots have
been symlinked into ram disks. For persistent system states and user data,
there is the `/local` partition, which is mounted read-write and
can be extended to span the remainder of the flash medium.

The goal is that even if `/local` is unclean or even corrupted, the system
will still boot up with ssh and a sufficient system environment to allow for
remote repairs.

For system maintenance, the scripts [mn_make_writable](/overlay/usr/local/bin/mn_make_writable)
and [mn_make_readonly](/overlay/usr/local/bin/mn_make_readonly) can be used.
The shell prompt will inform you if you are in a directory that is currently
writable. After the next reboot, the system will again be read-only.

### Web interfaces

By default, you can reach a few web interfaces at `http://localhost:10080`, 
assuming you have forwarded the http port through your ssh connection, like
this:
```
user@your-bigbox:~ $ ssh -L 10080:localhost:80 medianet@your-pi
```
The most immediately useful is an auto-generated simple web GUI to set the
parameters of your DSP plugins.

If you have configured an external jump server for remote maintenance that
your deployed medianet Pi can "phone home to" in 
[/etc/medianet/mn_tunnel.conf](/overlay/etc/medianet/mn_tunnel.conf),
you can start/stop your maintenance tunnel and check its state at
`http://localhost:10080/medianet/Tunnel`.

If you have configured a local Icecast2 server to create a stream from your
JACK signal graph, you will find a corresponding link here as well (which
will require port 8000 to be forwarded as well).

### Features

As of June 2020, the medianet distribution integrates the following
applications ready-to-use:

#### Audio
* the JACK audio connection kit
* gpioctl, a quick and very dirty tool to use buttons and rotary encoders to
affect ALSA mixer settings or generate JACK MIDI, can be multicast to several
medianet nodes
* mod-host by falkTX and the MOD team (to run LV2 plugins for signal processing)
* a large collection of LV2 plugins, among them the latest x42 plugin set by
Robin Gareus and Vladimir Sadovnikov's lsp-plugins, all automatically built from
source
* Icecast2 and an ffmpeg-based encoder to stream Opus-encoded audio over http
from JACK
* Fons Adriaensen's zita-convolver convolution engine, to apply FIR filters to loudspeakers
* zita-ajbridge (to access a second sound card with an unsynchronized clock)
* zita-njbridge (to stream multichannel uncompressed audio on a local Ethernet
with < 20ms latency either point-to-point or multicast)
* zita-lrx, a Linkwitz-Riley multiband loudspeaker crossover
* Mike Brady's shairport-sync, an Apple AirPlay(tm) and AirPlay2(tm) receiver

#### Video
> Due to the upstream switch from v4l2 to libcamera, v4l2rtspserver is currently
> broken. Working on a fix.
* Michel Promonet's v4l2rtspserver and a gstreamer-based low latency stream
playback service, to be used as an affordable HDMI network extender in
combination with a 30 â‚¬ USB HDMI grabber, or to stream the Pi camera, with
latency significantly below .5 seconds

#### Other tools
* cpufreq to set min and max core frequencies and governor (great to save power)
* lv2rdf2html to generate a simple but useful web UI for all the lv2 plugins you
configured to run in mod-host
* an SSH-based maintenance tunnel with "phone home" capability that will survive
reboots

Other services can be added easily if you don't mind dealing with a JSON parser
written in BASH (but using JQ, so it's not that bad).

## The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

This system has many very very ugly things going on. Shitloads of BASH
scripting, horrible JSON parsing, and (gasp!) even XSL transformations from
RDF/XML to HTML.

The good thing is that all these atrocities only serve to generate stuff. 
That means as soon as your system is running and actually doing its job, the
shell scripts are are out of the way and cannot affect system reliability or
efficiency.

The Bad things are listed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nettings/medianet/issues).

In general, the philosophy is to modify a standard base distribution in a
reproducible, discoverable way for reliable headless unattended low latency
media operation. 

Each installation step is a separate script that can be read as a HOWTO for
accomplishing a particular task. Symlinking customized files into the base
distribution rather than overwriting files will make modifications obvious
and will help you customize or improve the system for your own needs.

## Updating your system

It is generally safe to apply all minor Debian/RaspiOS rolling upgrades
within the same release at any time (`sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade`).
Updating the medianet part is still work in progress. Unless there have been 
major changes, applying the steps in
[sbin/110-update_as_user_medianet](/sbin/110-update_as_user_medianet)
should get you most of the way. More fundamental changes will necessitate
other configuration steps which will be documented separately.

Doing a full distribution upgrade from one RaspiOS major release to the next
is not officially supported by the RaspiOS team, but usually possible.
For a dedicated system like this with minimal configuration and
customization, it is however advisable to just back up your personal 
configuration changes and roll a new image from scratch rather than updating
in place.

## File system structure

* [custom_builds/](/custom_builds) contains checkout and build instructions for
third-party packages that are being built from source, because they are either unavailable
or too old in Debian upstream
* [lib/](/lib) contains BASH script includes and system-wide constants that are used in all
medianet-related tools. You might be interested in tweaking some of them.
* [overlay/](/overlay) mimics the system directory structure. Its contents will be symlinked
into the running base system. This is the runtime stuff that makes up the medianet distribution.
* [sbin/](/sbin) contains scripts that are only used during initial system bootstrapping,
maintenance, or upgrade.
