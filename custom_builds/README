This directory holds git checkouts of any additional software.
You can automatically populate it with bin/mn_checkout, 
and build all components in one go with bin/mn_compile.
To include a new custom component FOO, you need to write two little modules:
bin/mn_checkout.FOO, which fetches the software, and
bin/mn_compile.FOO, which builds it, adding all necessary fixes and compiler flags.
