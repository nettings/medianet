This directory holds git checkouts of any additional software.
You can automatically populate it with bin/mn_checkout, 
and build all components in one go with bin/mn_compile.

To include a new custom component FOO, you need to write two little modules:
bin/mn_checkout.FOO, which fetches the software, and
bin/mn_compile.FOO, which builds it, adding all necessary fixes and compiler flags.
These modules contain shell commands, but need not be executable, as they are included ("sourced") by the master script.
Checkout modules execute with custom_builds/ as their current working directory.
Compile modules execute in the respective source directory.
