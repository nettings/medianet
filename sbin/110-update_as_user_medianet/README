# Updating the medianet distribution

This is a first sketch for a generic update procedure.
Depending on the nature of medianet updates, other actions might be necessary
that will have to be specified by the update itself.

Note that a scripted `git pull` may fail depending on whether we check out from
a private or public repository. In case of problems, pull in `/medianet` from
the command line and check for errors.
Key handling needs to be specified and implemented.
