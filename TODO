FIXME: move checkout and compile scriptlets into neat sub-directories of custom-builds/ - what was I thinking?
FIXME: move mn_mod* cronjobs to system crontab and run as user medianet
FIXME: properly integrate alsa-restore.service for smooth fade in and out on reboot
FIXME: refactor fading code (constant fade time, automatic step size, curve)
DONE: don't optimize custom builds so agressively (they don't run on RPi2 anymore). Maybe find a good march=native setting?
