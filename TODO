DONE: don't optimize custom builds so agressively (they don't run on RPi2 anymore). Maybe find a good march=native setting?

FIXME: use BindTo=jackd.service for all jack clients.

FIXME: figure out why time-sync.target does not work on raspbian stretch

FIXME: move checkout and compile scriptlets into neat sub-directories of custom-builds/ - what was I thinking?

FIXME: move mn_mod* cronjobs to system crontab and run as user medianet

FIXME: properly integrate alsa-restore.service for smooth fade in and out on reboot

FIXME: handle device name for fades in case it's not hw:0 (USB!)

FIXME: refactor fading code (constant fade time, automatic step size, curve)

FIXME: RPi3B+ with externally powered USB interface does not reboot cleanly (back-powering?)

FIXME: USB audio interface dies when filesystems are remounted read-only:
