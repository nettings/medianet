* make overlay deployment script create intermediate directories if necessary (causes bug in sm.lv2 and icecast deployment)
* remove code duplication between boot and overlay deployment scripts

* fix bug in deployment script:
/usr/local/man/man1/mod-host.1.mn_.mn_: No backup required. Linked.
/usr/local/man/man1/mod-host.1: mv: failed to access '/usr/local/man/man1/mod-host.1.mn_': Too many levels of symbolic links
Failed to create backup '/usr/local/man/man1/mod-host.1.mn_'.ln: '/medianet/overlay/usr/local/man/man1/mod-host.1' and '/usr/local/man/man1/mod-host.1' are the same file
 Failed to link.
/usr/local/man/man1/mod-host.1.mn_.mn_.mn_: Created backup '/usr/local/man/man1/mod-host.1.mn_.mn_.mn_.mn_' Linked.

* fix problem with locale generation (subsequent errors, locale still not found)
